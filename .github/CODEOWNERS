# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these owners will be
# requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies YML files, only these owners and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.yml   @derrick-roach 

# These owners are responsible for any file in the `/docs` directory
# in the root of your repository and any of its subdirectories.
